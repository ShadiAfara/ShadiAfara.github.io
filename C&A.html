    <h2>What Does Communicate & Apply Mean?</h2>
    <p>"Where students apply their understanding and discuss, listen, write, perform, respond to feedback and present processes, knowledge and implications of research, heeding ethical, cultural, social and team issues and audience needs."</p>

	<h2>How it was applied in my work</h2>
	<center><p>Finally, after two iterations of instructions, we were asked to create a final version in RWDA #6. The assignment asked us to connect the dots between our assignments and the facets of research. More specifically, we were asked to use what we learned along with the feedback we received to create one final iteration that fulfilled all the requirements. We created tables to log the changes we made and why. Additionally, we were even asked to use the accessibility checker in MS Word to make the document accessible to everyone, regardless of the situation. Overall, the skills I developed throughout the course by giving feedback to my peers, in both oral and written form have taught me to be a better communicator and a better writer.</p></center>
