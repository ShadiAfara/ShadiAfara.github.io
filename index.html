    <h2>Welcome to Shadi Afara's ePortfolio</h2>
    <p>My name is Shadi Afara and I am a 4th-year student at York University, studying Information Technology. I am looking forward to completing my degree and graduating this coming June. After graduation, I am looking forward to starting my career in software engineering and systems design. Throughout one's professional career, research and communication skills are key to progression and success. Taking part in WRIT 3988 provides me with a foundational understanding of the communication skills required in my professional life and will hopefully propel me forward into my fields of interest. </p>

	<h2>Purpose:</h2>
	<center><p>My ePortfolio is a culmination of my research and experiences from WRIT 3988. Providing examples of what I learned since week 1 until now, my ePortfolio demonstrates and displays how I improved over the semester.</p></center>
